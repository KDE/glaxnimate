The "A" slider changes the color opacity (Alpha).

The two color indicators show the main (fill) color and secondary (stroke) color.<br/>
Clicking on either of them shows a dialog which gives similar controls as the ones in
the view, but more compact. And also allows picking colors from the screen.

The *Swap* button <img src="/img/ui/icons/swap-panels.svg" width="32" /> swaps the two colors.

Finally, there's a textbox with a hexadecimal representation of the main color.

### Composition Tabs

![Composition Tabs](/img/screenshots/views/timeline/composition_tabs.png)

If you have multiple compositions in the current document, they are shown in a tab bar
above the property list and timeline.

Clicking on the tabs will switch to a different composition.

### Property and Object List

![Property List](/img/screenshots/views/timeline/property_list.png)

On its left handside, the Timeline view has the list of objects and properties.

For shapes and other obects, it shows their group color, visibility, lock status, and name.
All of those can be modified from the timeline itself.

Additionally, top-level layers can also have a parent, which is also shown and edited from the timeline.

Nested inside each object, you can see their children and properties.

Properties show their name, current value, and animation status.


The animation statuses are as follow:

<img alt="Green Circle" src="/img/ui/keyframe_status/not-animated.svg" width="32" /> Not animated<br/>
<img alt="Yellow Key" src="/img/ui/keyframe_status/key.svg" width="32" /> Currently on a keyframe<br/>
<img alt="Multiple Circles" src="/img/ui/keyframe_status/tween.svg" width="32" /> "Tweening" value, between keyframes<br/>
<img alt="Red Triangle" src="/img/ui/keyframe_status/mismatch.svg" width="32" /> Animated value that has been moved without adding a keyframe

### Keyframe Timeline

The right handside of the Timeline view shows the actual timeline.


Pressing left/right arrow keys changes the current frame when this area is focused.


#### Time Bar

![Time Bar](/img/screenshots/views/timeline/time_bar.png)

The bar at the top highlights the current frame.
Clicking or dragging with the mouse will jump to the frame whose number is under the mouse cursor.

#### Keyframe Area

![Keyframe Area](/img/screenshots/views/timeline/keyframe_area.png)

Under that, there are rows for each of the animatable properties, and icons showing the keyframes for said properties.

The keyframes icons can be selected by clicking (To select multiple Shift-click or Ctrl-click). and dragged with the mouse to change their time.

The keyframe icons show different shapes and colors depending on the easing transition of the keyframe before and after the icon.

<img alt="Yellow Diamond" src="/img/ui/keyframe/linear.svg" width="32" /> Linear, values change from the start to the end of the keyframe at a constant rate<br/>
<img alt="Blue Circle" src="/img/ui/keyframe/ease.svg" width="32" /> Smooth Easing, values change more slowly at the start or end of the keyframe<br/>
<img alt="Red Square" src="/img/ui/keyframe/hold.svg" width="32" /> Hold, the value remains constant until the next keyframe<br/>
<img alt="Purple Circle" src="/img/ui/keyframe/custom.svg" width="32" /> Custom curve, defined with the dialog described in [Custom Easing Dialog](#custom-easing-dialog)<br/>

*Ctrl + Mouse Wheel* will zoom the area with respect to time, *Mouse Wheel* by itself moves left or right.
To scroll up and down either use the scrollbar to the side or use the *Mouse Wheel* on the property list.

Layers will be displayed as rectangles that spans between the first and last frames of that layer:

![Keyframe Area with Layers](/img/screenshots/views/timeline/layers.png)

#### Context Menus

Right clicking on the row of a property, will show a context menu with the name of the property and the ability to add a keyframe:

![Property Menu](/img/screenshots/views/timeline/property_menu.png)

Clicking on "Add Keyframe" will add a keyframe at the current frame with the current value of the property.

Right clicking on an existing keyframe icon, will show a menu with options relating to that keyframe:

![Keyframe Menu](/img/screenshots/views/timeline/keyframe_menu.png)

Clicking on "Custom..." for the incoming or outgoing transitions will show the [Custom Easing Dialog](#custom-easing-dialog).

### Custom Easing Dialog

![Custom Easing Dialog](/img/screenshots/views/timeline/custom_easing.png)

This dialog gives full freedom to specify easing curves.

The curve represents how the value changes between two keyframes:
the horizontal axis represents the time between the two keyframes
and the vertical axis is the interpolation factor between the two values.

To choose a preset transition for one of the two ends, you can select a value from the dropdowns.


Align
-----

![Align View](/img/screenshots/views/align.png)

This view shows alignment options, the same actions are available in the [Align Menu](menus.md#align).

It's hidden by default, to show it use the *View* > *Views* > *Gradients* menu action.

At the top of the view is the list of gradients, showing a preview, its name,
and the number of shapes using it.

Below that, you have a few buttons:

* <img src="/img/ui/icons/list-add.svg" width="32" /> Adds a new gradient based on the current colors.
* <img src="/img/ui/icons/folder.svg" width="32" /> Adds a new gradients from a list of presets.

drag them off the rectangle to remove them, and double click to show a dialog to set the color.

Right-clicking shows this menu:

![Gradients View](/img/screenshots/views/gradients/edit_context_menu.png)


### Editing from the Canvas

With the [edit tool](tools.md#edit-tool) active, the gradient controls will appear on the canvas.<br/>

Dragging the end points will change the extent of the gradient and dragging the smaller handles
will change the offset of the corresponding gradient stop.

For a Linear gradient:

![Linear Gradient](/img/screenshots/views/gradients/linear.png)

For a radial gradient:

![Radial Gradient](/img/screenshots/views/gradients/radial.png)

When you have a radial gradient, you can shift click on the start handle to reveal
a new X-shaped handle that controls the highlight position for the gradient:

![Radial Highlight](/img/screenshots/views/gradients/radial_highlight.png)

To hide it again, shift-click on it.


Swatch
------

![Swatch View](/img/screenshots/views/swatch/swatch.png)

This view shows the colors in the document swatch.

The document swatch is a palette specific to the open document.
When an object is assigned a color from the document swatch, it gets linked to it.
Modifying the color in the swatch will reflect the change in all linked objects,
so you can recolor multiple objects at once.

The view shows the palette for the document swatch, which each color in its own
rectangle. There is an extra rectangle that's used to unlink the selected object
from the swatch (the object will retain its color but modifying the swatch will no
longer affect that object).

These are the buttons at the bottom:


<img src="/img/ui/icons/open-menu-symbolic.svg" width="32" /><br/>
Clicking and holding on this button will show [a menu with extra options](#swatch-extra-options).

<img src="/img/ui/icons/list-add.svg" width="32" /><br/> Adds the current fill color to the swatch.
  If an object is selected, its fill color will be linked to the swatch.

<img src="/img/ui/icons/list-remove.svg" width="32" /><br/> Removes the last clicked color from the swatch

### Swatch Extra Options

![Menu Extra](/img/screenshots/views/swatch/extra_menu.png)

<img src="/img/ui/icons/document-export.svg" width="32" /> *Generate* <br/>
Pulls the colors off the open document and link all objects to the swatch

<img src="/img/ui/icons/document-open.svg" width="32" /> *From Palette...*<br/>
Shows a [dialog](#from-palette) with option to populate the swatch from an existing palette.

<img src="/img/ui/icons/document-save.svg" width="32" /> *Save Palette*<br/>
Saves the swatch and it will show up as a [palette in the Fill and Stroke views](#palette).

### Mouse interactions

Left-clicking on one of the rectangles of the swatch will link the fill color of the selected object
(or unlink if you click the rectangle marked with an X).

Holding Shift when you click will affect the stroke color instead of the fill color.

Right clicking will show the following context menu:

![Context Menu](/img/screenshots/views/swatch/context_menu.png)

At the top of the menu you see the name of the color

<img src="/img/ui/icons/edit-rename.svg" width="32" /> *Rename...* <br/>
Shows a dialog where you can change the name of the color.

<img src="/img/ui/icons/color-management.svg" width="32" /> *Edit Color...* <br/>
Shows a dialog where you can change the color

<img src="/img/ui/icons/list-remove.svg" width="32" /> *Remove* <br/>
Will remove the color from the swatch.
This will have no visual changes, but all objects previously linked to this
color will be unlinked.

<img src="/img/ui/icons/edit-duplicate.svg" width="32" /> *Duplicate* <br/>
Will add a new identical color to the swatch.

<img src="/img/ui/icons/list-remove.svg" width="32" /> *Set as fill* <br/>
Does the same as clicking

<img src="/img/ui/icons/format-fill-color.svg" width="32" /> *Set as stroke* <br/>
Does the same as shift-clicking

<img src="/img/ui/icons/format-stroke-color.svg" width="32" /> *Link shapes with matching colors* <br/>
Searches the document for all shapes with the same color as the one in the rectangle you clicked, and links them to the swatch.

### From Palette

![From Palette Dialog](/img/screenshots/views/swatch/from_palette.png)

At the top it shows a dropdown with the palettes currently loaded by glaxnimate.
The selected item will define the colors used by the document swatch.

To add more palettes, you can do so in the [Palette section of the fill View](#palette).

* *Overwrite on save* means that clicking *Save Palette* for the document swatch
  will overwrite the selected palette.
* *Link shapes matching colors* When checked, Glaxnimate will scan the document
  for objects with colors in the palette and link them to the swatch.
* *Remove existing colors* If checked, any existing colors in the document swatch
  will be removed before adding new ones from the palette.
  Note that this means all objects will become unlinked.
